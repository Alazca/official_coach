# Strength & Conditioning AI Assistant

## Overview

This project is a web application that provides personalized strength and conditioning workout plans using AI. It allows users to input their fitness goals, experience level, and available equipment, and then generates customized workout routines tailored to their needs.

## Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system.
*   **Profile Management:** Users can create and manage their profiles, including fitness goals, experience level, and available equipment.
*   **AI-Powered Workout Generation:** Generates personalized workout plans based on user input using an AI model.
*   **Exercise Database:** A comprehensive database of exercises with descriptions, images/videos, and instructions.
*   **Workout Tracking:** Users can track their progress and record their workouts.
*   **Progress Visualization:** Displays user progress through charts and graphs.
*   **Responsive Design:** The web app is designed to work well on different devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

## Technologies Used

*   **Backend:**
    *   Python
    *   Flask (web framework)
    *   SQLAlchemy (ORM)
    *   PostgreSQL (database)
    *   [List any other backend libraries]
*   **Frontend:**
    *   JavaScript
    *   [Choose one: React, Angular, Vue.js] (JavaScript framework)
    *   [Choose one: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Materialize] (CSS framework)
    *   HTML
    *   CSS
    *   [List any other frontend libraries]
*   **AI:**
    *   [Describe your AI model: e.g., Machine learning model trained on a dataset of workout plans]
    *   [List any AI-related libraries: e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch]
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Gunicorn (WSGI server)
    *   Nginx (reverse proxy)
    *   [Choose one: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure] (cloud platform)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   Python 3.9 or higher is installed.
*   [If using PostgreSQL] PostgreSQL is installed and running.
*   [If using Poetry or PDM] Poetry or PDM is installed.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone ADD
    cd official_coach
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    *   **Using `venv` (if not using Poetry or PDM):**

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv coach
        source coach/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
        # OR
        coach\Scripts\activate  # Windows
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    *   **Using the `venv`:**

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

4.  **Configure the application:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

        ```
        FLASK_APP=app.py
        FLASK_ENV=development  # Or production
        SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>  # Generate a random secret key
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>  # PostgreSQL connection string
        # Add any other environment variables required by your application
        ```

    *   **Important:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual values.  *Never* commit your `.env` file to version control.

5.  **Initialize the database:**

    ```bash
    # Assuming you're using Flask-SQLAlchemy
    python
    >>> from app import db
    >>> db.create_all()
    >>> exit()
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    Or, if using Gunicorn:

    ```bash
    gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
    ```

2.  **Access the web app:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address and port where your application is running).

## AI Model Training (if applicable)

If your application uses a machine learning model, describe how to train the model:

1.  **Prepare the training data:**

    *   [Describe the format of the training data]
    *   [Provide instructions on how to obtain or generate the training data]

2.  **Train the model:**

    ```bash
    python ai_logic/train_model.py  # Example script
    ```

3.  **Update the model in the application:**

    *   [Describe how to update the AI model in the application (e.g., by replacing the model file)]
